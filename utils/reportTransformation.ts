/**
 * Combines reports from the `Run` and `Diff` stages into a `StdioTest` stage report.
 *
 * If the `experimentalModularize` flag is on in `StdioTest`'s configuration, this stage will be modularized into
 * multiple `Run` and `Diff` stages. However, the Grader currently outputs stage reports for `Run` and `Diff` stages
 * instead of a single `StdioTest` stage report. Hence, this function intends to merge the `Run` and `Diff` stage reports
 * into a single `StdioTest` stage report.
 *
 * The Grader is still investigating how to merge `Run` and `Diff` reports into a single `StdioTest` report. Once the Grader
 * has implemented the stage report merging, this function is no longer necessary.
 *
 * @param runReport Report of the `Run` stage.
 * @param diffReport Report of the `Diff` stage.
 * @returns Report of a `StdioTest` stage, as if the `experimentalModularize` flag is off.
